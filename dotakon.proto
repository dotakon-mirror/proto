// # General Notes
//
// ## Signatures
//
// Some messages are cryptographically signed by the emitting node. These messages are generally
// structured as follows:
//
//   message SignedMessage {
//     message Payload {
//       // ...
//     }
//     optional .google.protobuf.Any payload = 1;
//     optional Signature signature = 2;
//   }
//
// See `NodeIdentity` for an example.
//
// For this kind of messages, the `type_url` of the `Any` must be set to
// `type.dotakon.org/fully.qualified.path.of.ThePayload` and the value must be the wire encoding of
// a `Payload` message. For example, the type_url of a `NodeIdentity` payload would be
// `type.dotakon.org/dotakon.NodeIdentity.Payload`.
//
// The attached signature refers to the bytes of the wire encoding of the `payload` message, which
// wraps the actual message. Using an `Any` achieves two important goals:
//
//   * it provides a type_url that acts as a domain separator, preventing misinterpretation attacks;
//   * and it clarifies that the signature refers to the bytes of the payload as encoded inside the
//     `Any` (the `Any` stores the encoded message as a raw byte array).
//
// The latter is important because protobuf encoding is not canonical: field ordering is not
// deterministic, it might have duplicated fields/tags, etc. But any actor that wishes to verify the
// signature needs to know exactly the byte array to verify.
//
// Note that the need for a wrapping `Any` reintroduces the encoding problem: `Any` has two fields
// (the type_url and the byte array) and it's unspecified which one is encoded first or whether a
// field is repeated more than once (the decoding is still unambiguous thanks to protobuf's Last One
// Wins rule). To address that we require that the whole `Any` is encoded canonically as follows:
//
//   * both fields must be present (as if they were required),
//   * field `type_url` (tagged 1) must be the first,
//   * field `value` (tagged 2) must be the second,
//   * there must not be repeated fields.
//
// Implementors don't need to modify their gRPC & protobuf frameworks to enforce this, they just
// need to know that, when signing or verifying, the signed/verified message must be encoded this
// way. Implementing canonical encoding for a known, two-field protobuf is quite easy and much
// better than implementing it generically for any protobuf.
//
// Note that since canonical encoding is only implemented for the wrapping `Any`, the wrapped
// message cannot be re-encoded without changing the signature.

  //  * the joiner calculates a valid topology and sends a signed `TopologyProposal`;
  //  * the responder either:
  //    * sends back a strictly better topology (lower variance of squared distances from
  //      centroids), or
  //    * agrees with the proposed topology;
  //  * after receiving signed agreement by the responder, the joiner:
